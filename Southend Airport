Southend was London's third busiest airport from the 1960s to the end of the 1970s, until London Stansted Airport overtook it in passenger numbers. Finding a parking spot is the most typical challenge when flying out of the airport. Travel Airport Plus strives to help consumers find the best parking spot at Southend Airport. Meet and greet, park and ride, short-term, and long-term parking are just some of the services we offer. Let's look into parking in more detail.

Meet And Greet Car Parking at Southend Airport
Travel Airport Plus offers a low-cost meet-and-greet service at Southend Airport. If you're looking for something a little more luxurious before flying, a Meet & Greet service sounds great. There's no need to go to any off-site parking lots with a Meet & Receive service; simply drive straight to the terminal gate, where a professional chauffeur will greet you and transport your vehicle to a secure parking lot nearby. We safeguard your vehicle with security fences such as CCTV cameras, roadblocks, number plate recognition, and security guards, so you don't have to worry about it.

Park And Ride Car Park
Another wonderful option at Southend Airport is park and ride parking. The most important thing to keep in mind about park and ride parking is that it is less expensive than other parking options because it is further away from the terminal. Select a parking location for your car at Southend Airport Parking, then board the airport shuttle bus. The bus ride will take about 4 to 5 minutes and will drop you off just yards from the airport's entrance.
